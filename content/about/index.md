Hello! My name is Akmal and Currently a 5th semester student with a passion for web
development started back in 2021 when I began learning website development on campus.

Actively engaged in the Dipanegara Computer Club Study Club, where I contribute to an
environment of shared learning and knowledge exchange. This involvement allows me to
stay updated on the latest industry practices and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts.
Eager to apply my skills and insights gained from both academic studies and practical
experience to contribute meaningfully to web development projects and explore new
opportunities in the field.
